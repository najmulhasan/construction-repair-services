              Electrical safety is our top priority. Our comprehensive
              electrical inspections identify potential hazards before they
              become dangerous problems. We recommend these inspections when
              purchasing a new property, after renovations, or if your
              electrical system is over 25 years old.
            </p>
            <p>
              During an inspection, our licensed electricians examine your
              entire electrical system, including the service entrance, panel,
              wiring, outlets, switches, and fixtures. We check for code
              violations, fire hazards, and signs of wear that could lead to
              future problems. Following the inspection, you'll receive a
              detailed report with recommendations for improvements to enhance
              safety and efficiency.
